# Platformer Game with PyGame

This repo contains code for a platformer game that I developed by following a tutorial by [DaFluffyPotato](https://www.youtube.com/@DaFluffyPotato). The tutorial covers the basics of Pygame development, including:

- Setting up the game window
- Images, Input & Collisions
- Player, Tiles, & Physics
- Camera & Sky
- Optimization
- Animation
- Creating a Level Editor
- Particles
- More Advanced Jumping and Sliding
- Enemies, Projectiles, Death & Particles
- Screenshake Effects
- Level Transitions
- Outlines & Shadows
- Audio
